URL Shortener using SQL, Python, and Flask API

Introduction:
In a world where sharing links has become ubiquitous, URL shorteners play a crucial role in making lengthy URLs more manageable and shareable. In this project, we will develop a URL shortener using SQL for data storage, Python for backend logic, and Flask for creating a RESTful API.

Features:

Shorten long URLs into unique, compact identifiers.
Redirect users to the original long URL when accessing the shortened link.
Store URL mappings efficiently in a SQL database.
Generate custom short URLs if desired.
Analytics to track the number of clicks and other relevant metrics for shortened URLs.
Technologies Used:

SQL: For storing the mapping between short and long URLs.
Python: For implementing the backend logic, including URL shortening and redirection.
Flask: For building a RESTful API to interact with the URL shortening service.
Implementation:

Database Design: Set up a SQL database to store the mappings between short and long URLs. The database schema may include tables for URL mappings and analytics.
Backend Logic: Write Python functions to handle URL shortening, redirection, and analytics. Utilize libraries such as hashlib for generating unique short URLs and flask_sqlalchemy for interacting with the SQL database.
Flask API: Develop a Flask application to expose endpoints for URL shortening, redirection, and analytics. Use Flask routes to define endpoints for each functionality, such as /shorten, /redirect, and /analytics.
Frontend (Optional): Create a simple web interface or integrate the API with existing web applications to allow users to shorten URLs directly from a browser.
Deployment: Deploy the Flask application to a web server or a cloud platform like Heroku for accessibility over the internet.
